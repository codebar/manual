### Running a codebar workshop

So you've decided to become a sponsor and host a codebar workshop? Great! Codebar would not exist without your support, so we really appreciate it! Now, here's what you need to know to run a successful codebar workshop.

#### Before the workshop

- If you can provide the venue, codebar can provide the people. Everyone who is subscribed to codebar in your area (or chapter) will be notified of the workshop you’re hosting. We usually send out invites a week in advance of the workshop.

- You’re welcome to invite up to five of your own guests to study at your workshop - just let us know who you’ll be bringing along..

- To help us spread the word further, send us a transparent png version of your logo and we’ll set you up on the events page on our site.

- Find a food supplier for the event. It’s important to provide vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options too. If you need help finding places to order from, get in touch with the codebar organiser and they'll help you find a place.

- As well as food, most of our sponsors provides drinks too. If you ‘re planning on serving alcohol, please supply a non-alcoholic option as well. Please at least supply water.

- Check if you have suitable WIFI in your office/event space. If you are expecting more than 20 people at the workshop, plan for a large number of people all trying to connect to the network at once.

- Make sure you have enough power outlets in the space you are planning to use. If not, it might be a good idea to provide some extension cables as people may need to plug their laptops in.

- Some workshops have a lightning talk, so access to a projector or tv would be great. If you would like to do a lightning talk at the workshop you are hosting, please let the codebar organisers know in advance so they can plan for it.

- It would be really helpful if you could print name tags on the day of the workshop. If you can, make sure you have some printing labels to hand - you can find them at any office supplies store or even your local supermarket. We usually use 2 x 7 layout.


#### On the day of the workshop

- Don’t forget to order the food from your supplier! Please ask to have it delivered around 6:15PM, as the official start time of the workshop is 6:30PM.

- A codebar organiser will send you an email with the final head count and any other important details. We can also send you a list of attendees, so if you need this let us know. However, please be aware that the list changes up until the last minute so it might not be 100% accurate. If you are printing name tags we will also send you a formatted PDF that you can use to print the tags.

- If the workshop has a confirmed lightning talk or you are doing one, set up the projector or screen so it's ready to go. It might be a good idea to have a selection of connectors on hand so people with a wide variety of machines can plug into it.

- If it is possible, please label one of your toilets as gender neutral. We recommend using this sign.

- Please have your WIFI details clearly visible.

- If there are any further questions you have, please don't hesitate to get in touch with any of the codebar team.


#### At the workshop

One of the organisers will be at the venue around 6:00PM (30 minutes before official start time) to help you set up the space and check people in. Sessions usually last two and a half hours. Relax, have fun and enjoy your time as a codebar workshop host!
